## **PLOT OF JOJO's BIZARRE ADVENTURE**
JoJo's Bizarre Adventure's universe is a mirror of the real world with the addition of paranormal entities and forces. In this series, the characters have a capability to have supernatural powers, and the 2 major power systems are Hamon (波紋, "Ripple"), a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing and Stands (スタンド, Sutando), a transformation of one's inner spiritual power

The series is divided into distinct parts, each with its own set of characters and plot while remaining connected to the other part. Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular "JoJo".

The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter three parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.

### **Part 1: *[Phantom Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Blood)***

Volumes 1–5, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century England, Jonathan Joestar, the young son of a wealthy landowner, meets his new adopted brother Dio Brando, who loathes him and plans to usurp his position as heir to the Joestar family. When Dio's attempts are thwarted, he transforms himself into a vampire using an ancient Stone Mask and destroys the Joestar estate. Jonathan embarks on a journey, meets new allies, and masters the Hamon (波紋, "Ripple") martial arts technique to stop Dio, who has made world domination his new goal.

Volumes 5–12, 69 chapters. In 1938, German researchers discover three lifeforms called Pillar Men, powerful humanoids responsible for the creation of the Stone Mask.

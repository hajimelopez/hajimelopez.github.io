JoJo Bizarre Adventure is a manga series from Japan, written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. The manga series is still going strong even after its initial release in 1987. A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, Phantom Blood, which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007 but it is now.
